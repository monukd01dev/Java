Exception --> abnormal condition
When your programme is in running state and an abnormal condition(Exception) occur that abnormal condition is known as Exception.

Now, what is difference between error and exception handling?
 Suppose a process is running and an exception occurs and that exception is handled by JVM is known as exception handling and if JVM fails to handle that exception and process terminates/stops/fail than it's an error.

Types of Error in Java
--> Syntax Error
--> Logical Error
--> Runtime Error (Most Dangerous)

RunTime Error > Logical Error > Syntax Error

Now RunTime errors are most dangerous so these error must be handled. So to handle these errors we do Exception Handling.

Note --> Now EveryThing in Java is in form of objects and so as exception.

Now Why RunTime Exceptions or any other exceptions must be handled...
If we recall about the features of Java, language claims that it is a Robust language (Java Program Never Fails at RunTime). And language accomplish their claim by using Exception Handling (Which handle's the exceptions occur at runtime and saves java program from termination).

In Java to handle every type of exception that occur we have some predefined exception classes.

Now lets see Hierarchy of classes in java

--> Object class is the top most class of every class in java. If a class doesn't have any parent class by default object class its parent class.

--> Object class has a subclass Throwable class.
    --> Throwable class is the root/top most class in Exception Handling.

--> Throwable class further have two subclasses 1.Exception 2.Error
    --> Error class have all the exception that cannot be handled and these exceptions are known as unhandled exceptions. Example => StackOverFlow, OutOfMemory, IO Error etc.
    --> Exception class have a Subclass Runtime Exception and many others.

Types of Exception in Java...

1. Unchecked/Runtime Exception
    -> Exceptions that are not checked at compile time and caught at runtime and give error at runtime.
    -> Runtime Exception class and its subclasses and Error class and its subclasses are Unchecked Exception.

2. Checked/Compile Time Exception
    -> checked at compile time.
    -> All other exceptions are checked exception.
    -> Handler(Try,Catch...) are mandatory in this...
    -> Without Handler code give error at run time.
