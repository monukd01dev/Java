Polymorphism --> Poly(Many) + Morphism(Form)

When an object perform different different task in different different circumstances than this concept is known as polymorphism.

How to achieve polymorphism...
Note --> Polymorphism is only achieved by methods
Note --> Data members doesn't play any role in achieving polymorphism

There are two types or way of polymorphism
1. Compile time/ Early binding/ Method Overloading/ Static binding
    --> when methods bounds with their functionalities at compile time.


2. Runtime/ Late binding/ Method Overriding/ Dynamic binding
    --> When methods bounds with their functionalities at runtime.


==> Method Overloading
    --> There is only one way to achieve method overloading by changing the parameters list of a method
        -> but there are two ways to do so ...
            1. Changing the number of parameters
            2. Changing the data types of parameters
                -> Vise Versa is not allowed can cause ambiguity error
